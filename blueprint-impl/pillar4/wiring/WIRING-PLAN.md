# Pillar 4 — Wiring Plan (DEFERRED)
DO NOT EXECUTE until: AUTHORIZED TO WIRE

Targets (future):
- Referral code generation + attribution binding
- Fraud suppression logic (no delete; suppress rewards)
- Reward posting integration to ledger (derived values only)
- Share payload endpoint wiring (OS share is client-side; server supplies payload)

Explicit rule:
- Any src/** edits are forbidden until authorized.

Validation steps (future):
- attribution immutability tests
- fraud heuristic flags persist
- reward eligibility truth-table tests
