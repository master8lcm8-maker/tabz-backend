# Pillar 4 — Slice A

This layer defines:
- attribution truth
- immutable binding
- reward eligibility
- fraud override capability
- metrics emission contracts
- share trigger definitions
- lineage structure

NO wiring.
NO runtime dependency.
NO src edits.

Wiring happens only after Slice A across all pillars is complete.
