# Pillar 5 — Slice A

Defines authority surfaces for:
- app store compliance artifact keys
- signing readiness decision shape
- build reproducibility decision shape
- release manifest shape (semver/build/tag/artifact hashes)
- observability event envelope (traceId correlation)

NO wiring.
NO runtime dependency.
NO src edits.
