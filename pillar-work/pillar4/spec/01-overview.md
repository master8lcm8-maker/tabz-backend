# Pillar 4 — Growth & Network Effects (Blueprint Spec)

**Scope:** Referral/affiliate attribution, reward triggers, fraud prevention.  
**Non-scope:** UI dashboards/analytics (only truth capture tables/events).

## 4.1 Affiliate / Referral System (Masterprint)
- Referral code/link generation
- Attribution captured at signup
- Binding inviter ↔ invited (immutable after binding)
- Reward events emitted (ledger-based outcomes later)
- Fraud prevention (device/IP/replay/burst checks)

## 4.2 Viral Share Triggers
- Share payload builder
- Deep link routing format
- OS share sheet handoff (platform-specific later)

## 4.3 Retention Loops
- Streak logic
- Return bonuses
- Timed events

## 4.4 Attribution Tracking
- Referral → Signup → Action chain
- Reward eligibility truth capture

## Success Criteria
- Every reward is attributable to a single verified chain.
- Fraud heuristics are explicit and enforceable server-side.
