# Pillar 4 — Growth & Network Effects (Spec)

## MASTERPRINT: Affiliate / Referral
- referral link/code generation
- attribution at signup (bind inviter ↔ invited)
- reward events (ledger-based)
- fraud prevention

## Additional
- viral share triggers (payload + deep links)
- retention loops (streaks/bonuses/timers)
- attribution truth capture (referral→signup→action)

## Notes
- Blueprint/stubs only. Not app code.
- Must remain ledger-compatible (rewards = ledger entries).
